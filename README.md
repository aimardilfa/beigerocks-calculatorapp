# beigerocks-calculatorapp
This is my custom-built Calculator App, developed using the Windows Forms Application in C# with Visual Studio. I designed it to offer a smooth and user-friendly experience for performing basic arithmetic operations. Whether you're doing simple math or trying out a few more complex expressions, this calculator handles it with ease. I aimed for a clean interface and efficient performance, making it both functional and visually straightforward for all users.

Here are some key features of my calculator app:
🔢 Easy Number Calculations – Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with accurate results.
🛡️ Zero-Division Protection – The app handles division by zero gracefully, without freezing or crashing.
🧼 Clear Output Button – Quickly reset the calculator’s display with a simple button click.

That’s all I have to share for now—hope you enjoy using it! 😊
